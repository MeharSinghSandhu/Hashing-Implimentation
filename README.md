 - Any resource you used for assistance
        -- I used lecture slides , office hours for assistance

 - The state of your implementation – whether any functionality is missing or the assignment is complete
        -- As per my knowledge the assignment is complete.
           Every functionality is present and as per my testing I see no memory leaks.

 - A summary of your new hashing algorithm, explaining whether and how it meets its must, should and ideally goals
        -- The firstchar hashing technique is a very efficient  hashing method with fewer collisions that excels in applications that require quick hash computations. Its focus on the first character of keys enables a quick and consistent hashing process, making it an ideal choice for datasets with a wide range of initial characters. This method stands out for its simplicity and speed, making it an excellent choice for applications where speedy hashing is more important than intricate key analysis. The firstchar hashing method offers a straightforward approach to hashing, balancing efficiency with simplicity. It is ideal for contexts where the diversity of the key's initial characters can be used.
